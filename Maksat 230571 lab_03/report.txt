This lab helped me understand practical implementation of geometric transformations in image processing. I gained hands-on experience with OpenCV functions and learned how mathematical matrices are applied to digital images.
Geometric transformations are essential in many real-world applications such as:
Computer vision
Face recognition
Medical image analysis
Robotics navigation
This experiment strengthened my understanding of how images are manipulated mathematically using affine transformations.
