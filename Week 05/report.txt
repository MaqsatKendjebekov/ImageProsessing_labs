In this lab, I implemented histogram equalization and histogram matching using OpenCV and scikit-image. First, I applied histogram equalization to a grayscale image and observed that the contrast improved significantly. The histogram became more uniformly distributed, enhancing details in dark and bright regions. I then applied equalization to each RGB channel separately in a color image. This increased contrast but slightly changed the color balance.
Next, I performed histogram matching to transform the source image’s intensity distribution to match a target image. The source image adopted the brightness and contrast characteristics of the target. Finally, combining equalization and matching produced a clearer and visually consistent result under different lighting conditions.
