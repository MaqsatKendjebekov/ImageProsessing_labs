Lab 2 Report: Basic Arithmetic Operations on Images
Objective
The objective of this lab was to understand and apply basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on digital images and observe their effects on pixel intensity, image brightness, and contrast.
Description of Work
In this lab, a color image was processed using basic arithmetic operations. The image was first read and converted into appropriate formats (color, grayscale, and binary where required). Each arithmetic operation was applied by using a constant value or another image, and the resulting images were displayed for comparison with the original image.
Observations
Addition:
Adding a constant value to an image increased the pixel intensities, resulting in a brighter image. If the added value was too large, some pixel values reached the maximum limit, causing saturation and loss of detail in bright regions.
Subtraction:
Subtracting a constant value reduced pixel intensities, making the image darker. Higher subtraction values led to loss of details in darker areas, especially when pixel values approached zero.
Multiplication:
Multiplying the image by a constant greater than 1 increased brightness and contrast, while multiplying by a value less than 1 reduced brightness. This operation scaled pixel values proportionally and affected contrast more noticeably than addition or subtraction.
Division:
Dividing pixel values by a constant greater than 1 decreased the overall brightness of the image. Dividing by a value less than 1 increased brightness, producing an effect similar to multiplication. Division provided controlled brightness reduction without abrupt saturation.
Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how basic arithmetic operations directly influence pixel intensities and visual appearance of digital images. Addition and subtraction mainly affected brightness, while multiplication and division influenced both brightness and contrast. Understanding these operations is essential for image enhancement, normalization, and preprocessing in digital image processing applications.
